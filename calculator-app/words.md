# Word Value Calculator

This program calculates the numerical value of a word based on the position of each letter in the alphabet.

## Letter Values
- a = 1
- b = 2
- c = 3
...
- z = 26

## How it Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a word
2. Each letter in the word is converted to its numerical value
3. The values are summed to produce the final result

## Example
Input: "cat"
Calculation: 3 (c) + 1 (a) + 20 (t) = 24

## Usage
Run the program and enter a single word when prompted. The program will display both the final sum and the step-by-step calculation.
